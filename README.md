# ForgeHax

A Minecraft cheat that runs as a Forge mod.

## Installing

1. Download the latest version of [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) for the corresponding ForgeHax Minecraft version (this is important if you want to run older versions of ForgeHax).
2.  Download the latest ForgeHax build by going to the [releases](https://github.com/ug50/ForgeHax/releases) section.
Do NOT install the jar that contains `sources`. That one contains the source code and isn't compiled.
3. Place the ForgeHax jar into the `.minecraft/mods/` directory. If you want to organize by Minecraft version, you can place it under `.minecraft/mods/{mc.version}` where `mc.version` is the version of Minecraft running (ex: `.minecraft/mods/1.12.2`).
4. Launch Minecraft using the Forge profile. ForgeHax should now be loaded.
